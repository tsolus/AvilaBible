# AvilaBible

Hello and welcome to our Python for Data Analysis project. Our goal here was to predict which monk had written in the Avila Bible using the Avila dataset you can find on this link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00459/avila.zip. For that extend, we had to determine which attributes were importants and the one that were not along with cleaning the dataset of any unwanted data. Then, we had to chose the proper model to reach the best acurracy while avoiding over-fitting.

As the project was in two parts, you can find on the main branch our notebook and our PowerPoint presentation and on the AvilaAPI branch you will find ever file concerning the API. As we were completely new to the concept of Flask or APIs in general, our API runs only using the Postman software (download link: https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

The github viewer does not allow the vizualisation of bokeh and plotlyexpress so you can see the plot in the PowerPoint or in GoogleCollab :
